# Time Bullet Plugin for Obsidian

> Automatically add timestamps to your lists with minimal effort 🕒

## Features

- **Auto-timestamp task lists**: Converts `-[t]` to `[HH:mm] -` with current time when you press Space
- **Timestamp continuity**: When pressing Enter on a timestamped list item, the new line does not automatically include the current time (you can stop adding timestamps)
- **Toggle timestamps**: Add or remove timestamps from any line with a customizable hotkey
- **Minimal interference**: Works naturally within your existing workflow
- **No configuration needed**: Simple, intuitive functionality right out of the box

## Usage

### Creating a timestamped list

1. Type `-[t]`
2. Press the Space key
3. The text becomes `[{{time_stamp}}] - ` with the current time formatted based on your settings (default is HH:mm).
4. Continue writing your note

### Continuing a timestamped list

1. Press Enter at the end of a line that starts with `[{{time_stamp}}] -`
2. A new list item is created without timestamp (timestamp continuity is stopped)
3. Continue with your notes

### Toggle time bullets

1. Place your cursor on any line
2. Use the hotkey you've assigned to "Toggle time bullet" (set in Settings → Hotkeys)
3. The command will:
   - Add a timestamp to regular bullets: `- ` becomes `[HH:mm] - `
   - Remove timestamps from time bullets: `[HH:mm] - ` becomes `- `
   - Add both bullet and timestamp to plain text lines

## Use Cases

- **Meeting notes**: Track when different points were discussed
- **Daily logs**: Document when you completed different tasks
- **Research notes**: Record the time of observations or findings
- **Time tracking**: Keep a simple record of activities throughout your day

## Settings

- **Time format**: (default is HH:mm) - Customize your time format using Dayjs formatting found on the [dayjs documentation](https://day.js.org/docs/en/display/format)
- **Use UTC**: (default is true) - Use UTC time when creating a timestamp. If false, time will be local to your machine.

## Styling

The time is displayed in brackets `[]` before the bullet. To grey out the time, you can add the following CSS to your theme or in a CSS snippet:

```css
.cm-line {
  /* Grey out time in brackets */
}

.cm-line:contains('[08:30]') {
  /* This is not valid CSS, but you can use a theme that supports it or manually style */
}
```

Alternatively, the plugin includes a `styles.css` file that defines `.time-bullet-time` class, but it may not be applied automatically.
